# E. Luckie Portfolio

#### By E. Luckie

#### A brief introduction to who I am and the coding projects I have created.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Git

## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does as well as any other information you want users or other developers to have.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop
* Navigate to the top level of this directory
* Open portfolio/index.html in your web browser

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs

* When resizing browser window smaller, "get to know me" column overlaps with "why coding" and "projects created" sections.
