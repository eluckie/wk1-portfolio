    <h3>So why do I want to learn coding?</h3>
    <p>As a child, I taught myself some HTML basics and used to build websites and blogs for fun. It was an excellent way to utilize my creativity. As I got older, I instead found myself immersed in the world of retail management. I've since discovered my passions lie in physically creating things and exploring all the beauty the world has to offer. My goal is to utilize the time and skills developed in this course to be able to redirect my life so that my days may be full of my passions, mental stimulation, and creation.</p>
